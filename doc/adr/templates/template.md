## References <!-- optional -->

<!-- Import links of documents, websites, etc. which are relevant to the discussion. -->
- â€¦ <!-- numbers of references can vary -->


## Problem Statement and Context

<!--
A succinct statement of the problem at hand or the issue motivating this decision. This introductory
section frames the problem space and lays the foundation for the rest of the ADR.

Include any and all context that influences or constrains the decision.
-->


### Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

<!--
Use this section to call out all important forces which are influencing the problem and decisions.
These force may include technological, political, social, and project specific items. Any forces
which are in tension should be called out specifically so that they can be addressed as part of the
decision.
-->


### History <!-- optional -->

<!--
Reflect on historical thoughts, tools and implementations, acknowledging their strengths and
weaknesses, and prepare for making the case for the changes proposed here.
-->


### Future State / Proposal <!-- optional -->

<!--
Describe the desired outcomes from adopting this ADR. Calling it out specifically can help
people understand what will be different from their current ways of implementing or thinking.
-->


## Alternatives and Options Explored

<!--
What alternatives were explored?

Include options that you've considered and that may have been brought up by others during
brainstorming, feedback, PRD reviews, etc. Additionally, for each option, be sure to include
advantages and disadvantages to each as well as trade-offs necessary.

Whenever possible, include mermaid and ASCII diagrams for each alternative/option. These type of
diagrams can be very beneficial for people who are visual learners.
-->


## Decision

**TL;DR; Short summary sentence of the final decision**

<!--
This section resolves questions raised under the Alternatives heading. It is a clear statement of
what the team has settled on as the most appropriate solution to the problem under consideration.

Be sure to include _why_ the decision was made in comparison to the alternatives and options
presented above. As part of the _why_ behind the decision, the reasoning behind accepting any and
all disadvantages or trade-offs of the chosen solution need to be clearly addressed in this section.

Additionally, it is good to include information about _how_ decision drivers impacted the choice. As
well as, what influence the history and long term architecture goals had on this decision.
-->


### Example Code <!-- optional -->

<!--
When the ADR involves changes to code idioms, patterns, structure, etc. it's helpful to provide code
samples, or even diffs, of the changes. This helps illustrate in concrete terms what someone can
expect to see as a result, as well as provide a reference further adoption throughout the
organization.

Similar to how mermaid and ASCII diagrams help those who are visual learners, this section provides
particular benefit for those who learn best by reading code.
-->


## Consequences

<!--
This section is intended to be a quick reference for later and thus should matter of factly state
the advantages and disadvantages of the decision. For example, what are the long term impacts? What
things do people need to keep in mind moving forward?

People can reference the Context and Decision sections for the _why_ behind it all.

Finally, make it clear in what the expectations are for other engineers. Do they need to start
making changes in their applications to reflect the decision? Do they need to make a change to their
way of working, or their toolchain? How can they get started? In short, what do teams need to do to
fulfill the requirements of the ADR?

This is also a good time to highlight any sort of follow-up items which are required. For example,
was any part of the decision punted on? Are there glaring unknowns which are being left until a
later time?
